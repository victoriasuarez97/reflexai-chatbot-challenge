# Reflex AI chatbot challenge 🤖

The goal of this challenge was to simulate a chat bot with few responses and connect the chat messages to a database. I created a chat bot using Vercel's SDK OpenAI and connect it to Vercel's Postgres database. I called it Catbot and it's a cat assistant to help users understand their cat behaviour.

## ✨ Setting up
To run this locally, install the node modules folder by typing ``npm i`` in your terminal. Make sure you are in the source folder. Then you should create an Open AI key in [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and also connect it to Vercel's Postgress which you can find the documentation [here](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart).
Once you have done that, you can run the command ``npm run dev`` and you are good to go.

Feedback is always welcome <3
